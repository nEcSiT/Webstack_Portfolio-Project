## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or using NexShop, refer to the troubleshooting steps below:

### Common Issues

#### 1. Database Connection Errors
- **Error:** `ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR: Access denied for user 'user'@'localhost'`
    - **Solution:** Ensure that your MySQL username and password in the `.env` file are correct. Verify that the MySQL server is running and accessible.

#### 2. Missing Environment Variables
- **Error:** `Missing required environment variable`
    - **Solution:** Check that all necessary environment variables are defined in your `.env` files for both the backend and frontend. Ensure there are no typos or missing values.

#### 3. API Key Issues
- **Error:** `Invalid API key`
    - **Solution:** Verify that your Google Maps API key is correct and has the necessary permissions enabled. Ensure the key is correctly set in the `.env` files.

#### 4. Port Conflicts
- **Error:** `EADDRINUSE: Address already in use`
    - **Solution:** Ensure that the ports defined in your `.env` files (e.g., `PORT=5000` for the backend) are not being used by other applications. Change the port number if necessary.

### Debugging Tips

- **Logs:** Check the console logs for detailed error messages. Both the backend and frontend servers will output logs that can help identify issues.
- **Network Requests:** Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests and responses. This can help diagnose issues with API calls.
- **Database:** Use MySQL tools (e.g., MySQL Workbench) to inspect the database and ensure tables and data are correctly set up.
